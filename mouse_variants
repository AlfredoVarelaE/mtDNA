## Strategy for the identification of single nucleotide variants in the
mouse mitochondrial genome

This document is supplementary to the article:
Alfredo Varela-Echavarría, Kenya L. Contreras-Ramírez, Carlos Lozano-Flores, and Maribel Hernández-Rosales (2024) Detection of single nucleotide variants in the mitochondrial genome of healthy mice and humans.

To map precisely the reads corresponding to the circular junction regions at the D-loop, tail-to-head junction sequences were made for the mouse mitochondrial genome by joining the 3kb of the end of the mm39 reference genome to 3kb of the start of the same sequence (THjnct)(Figure below). All reads from each sample were then aligned to the THjnct sequence and the full length linear sequence (FL). The example shown is for mouse and a similar strategy was employed for the human mitochondrial genome.
